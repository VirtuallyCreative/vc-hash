## Allegretto - The fast and lively CSS Framework


Allegretto, a musical term and my cat, is a CSS3 framework built around easy to use grids and WCAG accessibility.

Mainly created for rapid S.P.A. prototyping and wireframing. The concept behind the framework is "fast and lively" - the meaning of the musical term: Allegretto. It doesn't use any CSS pre-processors, has a minimal load impact and has a grid system that's familiar to almost any front-end developer who has used a CSS framework in the past.

Merging some concepts from Bootstrap like the `.row` and `.col` style classes, with newer concepts from Bulma.io like the `.is-` modifier for classes I feel is a nice mix of styles.
